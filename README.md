# Pac-Man-Factory

Currently one can create as many Pac-Man as possible, and once he or she hits start game, the Pac-Man would move accoss the screen in different direction and speed.

## Installation

Download the Zip file on this [link](https://github.com/tlswodnjs/Pac-Man_Factory/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to modify or adjust the project.

## Roadmap

In the future, I am planning to adjust so that the Pac-Man image would chage from going forward and back as soon as possible.
