# Pac-Man-Factory

The Pac-Man Factory allows one to create as many Pac-Man by clicking "Add PacMan". Every time this button is clicked, a new Pac-Man is created and placed on the screen at random with each unique direction and speed.

At the same time, there is also a "Start Game" button that moves each Pac-Man across the screen at the different speed and direction as determined previously. So far the Pac-Man will be facing one direction and bounce of the edges of the screen.

## Installation

Download the Zip file on this [link](https://github.com/tlswodnjs/Pac-Man_Factory/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to modify or adjust the project.

## Roadmap

In the future, I am planning to adjust the Pac-Man so that when it hits a screen border, the image would flip 180 as it turn the opposite direction. I am also planning to make updates so that the Pac-Man will bounce off each other vs. a just going over one another.
